Title: AI-Powered Electricity Bill & Consumption Predictor

1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

Electricity consumption and billing are key aspects of household and industrial energy management. This project provides an AI-powered tool to:

Predict electricity bill, consumption, connected load, and load class.

Provide interactive visualizations to analyze patterns.

Enable decision-making for energy optimization.

The project is built with Python (Streamlit, Scikit-learn, XGBoost) and uses machine learning regression/classification models for prediction.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Objectives

Build a machine learning model that predicts electricity bill and usage.

Provide an easy-to-use web interface via Streamlit.

Visualize predictions with distribution plots to compare against dataset.

Enable users to upload their own CSV dataset for predictions.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Description

The project uses a dataset (hackathon.csv) with the following columns:

LOAD ‚Üí Connected load in kW

CONSUMPTION_KWH ‚Üí Electricity consumption in kWh

BILLED_AMOUNT ‚Üí Electricity bill in ‚Çπ

‚úÖ Dataset can be replaced with custom CSVs having the same structure.

4Ô∏è‚É£ System Architecture

Workflow:

Data Loading

Load CSV dataset using Pandas.

Handle missing values, outliers, and scaling if needed.

Model Training

Train regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Evaluate using R¬≤, RMSE, MAE.

Prediction

Accept user input (or new data rows).

Predict bill, consumption, and load class.

Visualization

Show histograms of LOAD, CONSUMPTION_KWH, and BILLED_AMOUNT.

Highlight prediction with a red dashed line.

Frontend (Streamlit)

Interactive web app.

File upload / manual input.

Displays results + graphs.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python 3.10+

Frontend: Streamlit

Libraries:

pandas, numpy (data handling)

matplotlib, seaborn (visualization)

scikit-learn (ML models & evaluation)

xgboost (advanced ML model)

6Ô∏è‚É£ Implementation
Key Files

app.py ‚Üí Main Streamlit app.

data_utils.py ‚Üí Data loading utilities.

model_utils.py ‚Üí ML model training functions.

evaluate_model.py ‚Üí Model evaluation (R¬≤, RMSE, MAE).

Running the Project
# step 1: Create Vertual environment
python -m venv venv 
venv\Scripts\activate

# Step 2: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 3: Run the app
streamlit run app.py

7Ô∏è‚É£ Results

Prediction accuracy: Random Forest & XGBoost give the best performance.

Visualization: Histograms clearly show how predictions compare to dataset distribution.

Example:

Input: LOAD=5, CONSUMPTION=300 ‚Üí Predicted Bill = ‚Çπ1200.

The bill falls within the normal range, as shown by the red dashed line.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Use Cases

Electricity Boards ‚Üí Demand forecasting, load analysis.

Consumers ‚Üí Estimate upcoming bills, optimize usage.

Smart Grids ‚Üí AI-based energy monitoring.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Future Enhancements

Add time-series forecasting for monthly bills.

Deploy on Streamlit Cloud / AWS.

Add tariff-wise billing models.

Build a mobile app frontend.
